// MARK: Comment about app preformance testing

// To test the preformance, I used instruments to see which tasks were taking a longer time to load and the number of those tasks. I found that there were a large amount of calls being made to refresh the CollectionView that were taking away system resourses and causing some other problems. Then I went back and moved all the refreshing code for images from the ViewController to the image cell. After it was moved the app preformed much better and had much less of an overhead on system resourses!
